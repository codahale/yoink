Now with more things:

* Small code refactoring.
* Added a mild smattering of documentation.
* Added `Atom`, a Scala-y atomic reference.
* Added `MutablePersistentHashMap` and `MutablePersistentTreeMap`, which are
  backed by atomic references to Clojure's persistent, immutable maps.
* Now cross-compiled for 2.8.0.Beta1 and 2.8.0.RC2.
